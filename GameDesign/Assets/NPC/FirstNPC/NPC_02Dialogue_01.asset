  - Who is there? I can hear your footsteps ...
  - Oh, a fellow android ... I hope you are not here to take more parts from me ...
  - I don't know how much longer I can keep going. One day, my system will shut down.
  - You want to get past the gate? I could help you with that.
  - I've been programme to secure this entrance. I'm the one who holds the key.
  - My nature of serving the others has led me to decay. Each day they come and take
    more and more parts from me only so they can sustain themselves.
  - And I can't no longer fight back. If you want me to open the door, please help
    me with something ...
  - Go down the ladder, into the sewers and take my the laser from those selfish
    bastards. We will talk more after you come back with it.
