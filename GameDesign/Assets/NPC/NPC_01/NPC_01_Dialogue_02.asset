  - Oh hey ... please don't kill me. I'm not looking for trouble.
  - I just saw you rising from that pile of bodies.
  - You seems quite confused.
  - Right now you are in X, the androids disposal pit. And the neighbourhood where
    me and my fellow humans found shelter after the new laws ...
  - You are an old model, an enforcer one judging by your design.
  - Unfortunately you were decommissioned. But somehow you managed to wake up.
  - 'You should go and check NPC_01. She''s in the building next door. Go straight
    ahead and upstairs. '
  - But be careful, radioactive residues were left on the ground after authorities
    attempted to get rid of the old models by melting them.
