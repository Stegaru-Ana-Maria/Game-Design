  - Oh, it's you again. What? You got rid of the enforcer? Thank the stars!
  - As I promised, I will help you with whatever you need.
  - Mhm, so you want to find your android friend that works in security, Serah.
  - Look, I don't know for how long you've been shut down but things have changed.
    One day, something unexpected happened in The Factory.
  - Someone else took control and turned the androids against us. We don't know who
    did this and what their motives were.
  - If your friend hasn't been decommissioned yet, then most likely her system has
    been already rewritten. But if you still want too look out for her ...
  - ... the shortest path to The Factory is going through the SilverCliff neighbourhood.
    You can take the shortcut there by going through the door upstairs.
  - But you will have to find the switch if you want to power it up. Something me
    and my friends didn't manage to find..
