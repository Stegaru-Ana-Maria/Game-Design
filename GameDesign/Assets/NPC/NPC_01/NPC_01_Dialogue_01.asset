  - Hey! You don't seem from around here ...
  - Aaron sent you to me? I see.
  - And you look like an enforcer but a model I haven't seen before.
  - Still, I don't know if I can trust you ...
  - ... Look, you have to prove me that you are not one of them ...
  - Upstairs, an enforcer is camping the door. I've tried to fight them before but
    it was unsuccesful.
  - Go and eliminate them. After that I will help you with whatever you need. What
    do you say?
  - I'm sure you remember how to throw some fists [X].
